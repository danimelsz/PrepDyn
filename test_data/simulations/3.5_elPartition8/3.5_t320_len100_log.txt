--- Command used ---
prepDyn(input_file='../test_data/simulations/2_aligned', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='../test_data/simulations/3.5_elPartition8/3.5', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_threshold=10, percentile=25, del_inv=False, internal_leaves='all', partitioning_method='equal', partitioning_round=8)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 320
No. columns: 108
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 30864 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 1127
Total no. IUPAC N: 0

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 9
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 44
Combined total: 53

L105: partition 3 (36–46, length 11) fully missing (all '-')
L106: partition 3 (36–46, length 11) fully missing (all '-')
L257: partition 5 (60–70, length 11) fully missing (all '-')
L257: partition 6 (72–82, length 11) fully missing (all '-')

--- Step 4: Partitioning (columns with # inserted) ---
