--- Command used ---
prepDyn(input_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical2_Chen/1_noPreprocessing', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical2_Chen/3_balanced/round1/output', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_method='semi', orphan_threshold=6, percentile=25, del_inv=True, internal_leaves='all', partitioning_method='balanced', partitioning_round=1)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 62
No. columns: 283
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 17470 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 0
Total no. IUPAC N: 0

--- Step 2: Trimming (invariant columns) ---
[]

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 0
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 0
Combined total: 0



--- Step 4: Partitioning ---
Method used: balanced
No partitions were inserted based on the criteria.

--- Summary after preprocessing ---
