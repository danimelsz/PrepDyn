--- Command used ---
prepDyn(input_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical2_Chiari/1_noPreprocessing', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical2_Chiari/3_balanced/round5/output', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_method='semi', orphan_threshold=6, percentile=25, del_inv=True, internal_leaves='all', partitioning_method='balanced', partitioning_round=5)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 9
No. columns: 1077
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 8982 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 711
Total no. IUPAC N: 0

--- Step 2: Trimming (invariant columns) ---
[0, 1]

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 709
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 0
Combined total: 709



--- Step 4: Partitioning ---
WARNING: 'balanced' partitioning with partitioning_round=5 was skipped for this alignment. This typically happens when the alignment has fewer blocks of missing data ('?') than required. The process will continue without partitioning this file.

--- Summary after preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 9
No. columns: 1075
No. pound sign columns (#): 0
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T): 8966 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 0
Total no. IUPAC N: 0
Total no. missing values (?): 709
