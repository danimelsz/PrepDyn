--- Command used ---
prepDyn(input_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical2_Chiari/1_noPreprocessing/', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical2_Chiari//6_max/output', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_method='semi', orphan_threshold=6, percentile=25, del_inv=True, internal_leaves='all', partitioning_method='max', partitioning_round=0)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 14
No. columns: 450
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 6300 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 0
Total no. IUPAC N: 0

--- Step 2: Trimming (invariant columns) ---
[0, 1, 447, 448, 449]

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 0
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 0
Combined total: 0



--- Step 4: Partitioning ---
Method used: max
No partitions were inserted based on the criteria.
